# ShaleOS
ShaleOS is my attempt at making my own operating system. It's a large step from making Unity games in C# and discord bots in JS, so don't expect it to be flawless.

ShaleOS (Or what I plan it to be) will be a lightweight, somewhat graphical operating system for x86 devices. And I will only ever make it for x86 devices. Learning assembly is already difficult enough, so I'm
just going to stick to one language.

Also, please don't expect this to be pratical. Like at all. I'm only doing this to test myself and learn about computers. Plus, it'd look good on my college and job resumes.
